# Fake-News-Classifier-using-bidirectional-LSTM

I built this project as a proof-of-concept fake news classifier using a bidirectional LSTM model. The classifier is trained on an unreliable Trump articles dataset from Kaggle to detect potential fake news.

To get started, download the dataset from [Kaggle Fake News Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/submit) and follow the instructions in the notebook.

This project is still a work in progress, and I plan to refine and update it further soon. Contributions, suggestions, or bug reports are welcome!
